H. kuda diet consists of zooplankton (Paulus 1999). The recorded maximum total length is 30 cm (stretched) (Paulus 1999).','In general, incidental capture in shrimp trawl fisheries and habitat  degradation and exploitation are the main threats to this species.  H. kuda is susceptible to incidental catch from trawling in many locations throughout its range (Giles et al. 2006, Perry et al.  2010).  In China, Cambodia and the Republic of Korea seahorses are  caught as bycatch although no information exists on volumes (UNEP-WCMC  2012b).  Declines in Thailand  of seahorse catches are attributed to overfishing, as well as an increasing number  of fishers, trawling, and habitat destruction (Perry et al. 2010).Hippocampus kuda is caught and traded for traditional medicines, aquaria and curios throughout its range (Perry et al. 2010). Trade in this species is extensive with over 2 million individuals traded per annum (Evanson et al. 2011, UNEP-WCMC 2012a).Hippocampus kuda is also threatened by damage to its habitats (Vincent et al. 2011) from coastal development and destructive fishing practices. Land-based activities such as coastal construction can diminish seagrass beds and mangroves while leading to increased pollution and siltation in surrounding marine waters. For  example, in Malaysia Hippocampus kuda numbers   declined due to an extensive port development around the Pulai Estuary   that destroyed large tracts of seagrass meadow (Vincent et al. 2011).  Fishing methods such as trawling result in substantial damage to seagrass beds globally, and especially in the Indo-Pacific (Short et al. 2011). The decline in and fragmentation of the species’ habitats throughout its range indicates possible declines in populations in addition to those caused by fisheries. All seahorse species have vital parental care, and many species studied to date have high site fidelity (Perante et al. 2002, Vincent et al. 2005), highly structured social behaviour (Vincent and Sadler 1995), and relatively sparse distributions (Lourie et al.   1999). These life history parameters often make species susceptible to   exploitation as has been demonstrated for a number of species,  including  seahorses (Jennings et al. 1998, Foster and Vincent  2004).  Although seahorses also have some traits, such as small body  size, fast  growth and high fecundity, that may confer resilience to  exploitation  pressures (Morgan 2007), Due to the mode of spawning exhibited by Hippocampus kuda (ovoviviparous brood pouch male parental care), fecundity is comparatively low compared to non-brood pouch spawning fishes and therefore its capacity for population growth is more limited than other species (Brown et al. 2008). As a result of the lack of broadcast spawning of pelagic eggs, dispersal of potential recruits is limited. Additionally, given the limited swimming abilities of seahorses, it is highly unlikely that rescue effects would occur from adjacent populations.'),(1118,'Aipysurus foliosquama','Leaf-scaled Sea Snake, Leaf-scaled Seasnake','Critically Endangered','Listed','reptiles','Elapidae','Squamata','Reptilia','Chordata','Animalia','http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1118',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2024,'unknown','Aipysurus foliosquama is described as a tropical shallow-water coral reef specialist favouring dense coral cover, based on observations at Ashmore Reef (Minton and Heatwole 1975). However, the discovery of a population at Shark Bay, Western Australia, suggests that this species can tolerate cooler waters and non-coral habitats. Habitat data for four individuals at Shark bay suggest they occur within seagrass beds that have sparse to no coral cover (D’Anastasi et al. 2016). Of eight diet records for A. foliosquama (from the Ashmore population), 50% were wrasses (Halichoeres spp.), 25% were benthic sleepers (Eleotridae) and the remaining were eels and blennies (Clinidae) (Sherratt et al. 2018).','Coastal habitats in northwest Australia are threatened by infrastructure developments and Sea Snakes are presently omitted from environmental impact assessments for industry (Sanders et al. 2015).

It feeds mostly on small reef fishes from the families Labridae (wrasses), and Gobidae (gobies) as well as eels and fish eggs (Voris 1972, McCosker 1975, Rasmussen 2001).Maximum size is typically 78 cm (Smith 1926, Francis 2006), though a specimen of 89 cm TL (A. Rasmussen pers. comm. 2009) and 96 cm SVL have been recorded (M. Guinea pers. comm. 2009).  Based on similar species, this species has a generation length of approximately five years, based on a longevity of approximately 10 years, and age of first maturity of 3-4 years.','There are no specific, clearly identified or quantified past, current or future threats to A. fuscus or any other reef-associated sea snake species, and it is unclear why populations at Ashmore, Hibernia and Cartier Reefs have declined. A. fuscus is not targeted by fisheries; there is no evidence that it is being illegally harvested; and is it not subject to incidental bycatch (some sea snake species are routinely captured as by-catch in trawls, but this is not the case for strongly reef-associated species such as A. fuscus; Lukoschek et al. 2007a).Nonetheless, something is clearly impacting this species and it is most likely that current and future threats relate to degradation or modification of shallow-water coral reef habitats from bleaching events due to increased sea surface temperatures. However, compared to other areas, the Ashmore Reef was not badly affected by the 1998 bleaching event (V. Lukoschek pers. comm. 2009), although it suffered severe bleaching in 2003 (Kaspartov et al. 2006). Thus, climate change may be a threat to some sea snake species (Francis 2006). In addition, increased water temperatures on the reef flat may exceed the upper lethal limit for A. fuscus, which has been reported to be 36°C for the sea snake Pelamis platurus (Graham et al. 1971).Habitat degradation and modification may also result in possible reduction in prey species abundances (i.e. small coral reef fishes).'),(1115,'Aipysurus apraefrontalis','Short-nosed Sea Snake, Short-nosed Seasnake','Critically Endangered','Listed','reptiles','Elapidae','Squamata','Reptilia','Chordata','Animalia','http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1115',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2024,'unknown','At Ashmore, this sea snake species was found on the reef flat and the reef edge, and usually associated with sandy substrata with sparse coral (Minton and Heatwole 1975). In the daylight hours, it was found resting beneath small coral overhangs or coral heads in 1-2 m water at Ashmore (McCosker 1975). The habitat preferences of the coastal population are poorly known. However, given that Aipysurus apraefrontalis is relatively common in trawl bycatch in the Exmouth Gulf, it may prefer soft bottom, non-reefal habitats.There are only three diet records for A. apraefrontalis (from the Ashmore population), two of which were eels and the other was an unidentifiable perch-like fish (Sherratt et al. 2018).Courting behaviour was observed in late April 2013 in Ningaloo Reef on coastal Western Australia; two males were reported to be in breeding condition during the winter in Exmouth Gulf (1973 and 2004); and a gravid female was collected in late spring in 1967 (Sanders et al. 2015, D’Anastasi et al. 2016). One pregnant female was collected in January 1973 from Ashmore (AMS R44899), which contained two full-term female embryos (snout vent length: 27 cm and 26.5 cm, Sanders et al. 2015). These limited observations are broadly consistent with existing knowledge of the reproductive biology of sea snakes in Australian waters, with mating during winter and parturition in spring or early summer (D’Anastasi et al. 2016).','There have been severe declines in the Aipysurus apraefrontalis subpopulations at Ashmore and Hibernia Reefs and the species has not been recorded on surveys in the region since 2000 (Elfes et al. 2013, Guinea and Whiting 2005, Lukoschek et al. 2013). The reasons for the local extinctions of these populations at Ashmore and Hibernian reefs are unknown. In coastal western Australia, A. apraefrontalis is caught as bycatch in prawn trawl nets, but the sustainability of interactions with fisheries is unknown (Sanders et al. 2015, D\'Anastasi et al. 2016, Udyawer et al. 2016).'),(66723,'Hippocampus kelloggi','Kellogg\'s Seahorse, Great Seahorse','Vulnerable','Listed','fishes','Syngnathidae','Syngnathiformes','Actinopterygii','Chordata','Animalia','http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=66723',0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,2024,'decreasing','Hippocampus kelloggi is most commonly associated with gorgonian corals and sea whips as well as soft bottomed habitats (Lourie et al. 2004). It can be found in relatively deep waters, with a maximum recorded depth of 152m (Choo and Liew 2003, Lourie et al. 2004, 2016). Little is known about feeding, but this species likely consumes small   benthic and/or planktonic crustaceans such as harpacticoid and cyclopoid   copepods, gammarid shrimps, and mysids (Woods et al. 2002, Kendrick and Hyndes 2005, Kitsos et al. 2008, Yip et al. 2015, Valladares et al. 2016).Seahorses including H. kelloggi are ovoviviparous and the males give birth to live young (Foster and Vincent 2004). All seahorse species have vital parental care, and many species studied to date have high site fidelity (Perante et al. 2002, Foster and Vincent 2004), highly structured social behaviour (Vincent and Sadler 1995), and relatively sparse distributions (Lourie et al. 1999)- these traits make seahorses vulnerable to over-exploitation. They also have some traits, such as small body size, fast growth and high fecundity, that may confer resilience to high levels of exploitation (Morgan 2007). However, a specialised life-history coupled with a dependence on habitats that are subject to extremely high fishing pressure, and the fact that seahorses do not move very much and are thus easily captured, means they are very vulnerable to over-exploitation (Foster and Vincent 2004).','Hipocampus kelloggi is threatened from bycatch in multiple artisanal as well as commercial fisheries throughout its range and this is the major threat facing this species (McPherson and Vincent 2004, Meeuwig et al. 2006, Murugan et al. 2008, Perry et al. 2010). Even though small numbers are caught per unit of effort, the number of individuals taken is substantial (Lawson et al. 2017). The species may also be targeted for use in the aquarium trade (Vincent et al. 2011). Destructive fishing practices such as dynamite fishing and trawling also threaten the species\' habitat (Vincent et al. 2011). Seahorses\' life history and ecological traits may increase their susceptibility to these threats.'),(22,'Neophoca cinerea','Australian Sea-lion, Australian Sea Lion','Endangered','Listed','mammals','Otariidae','Pinnipedia','Mammalia','Chordata','Animalia','http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=22',0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,2024,'decreasing','Australian Sea Lions are sexually dimorphic, with adult males reaching 1.25 times the length and 2.5-3.5 times the weight of adult females. Very little information on sizes of adult males is available, and some values in the literature may be overestimates. Adult males reach lengths of 1.8-2.5 m and weigh 180-250 kg. Females are 1.3-1.8 m in length and weigh 61-105 kg. At birth, pups are approximately 60-70 cm long and weigh 6-9 kg (Lowther and Goldsworthy 2011). Pups are dark chocolate brown to charcoal in colour at birth and lighten to a smoky grey before becoming brown. The pelage pattern of pups up until their moult at around 4 months of age is highly variable.Females become sexually mature at 4.5-6 years of age and males at six years or more. The mean age of breeding females is 11 years (McIntosh 2007). The oldest breeding female recorded was aged 24 years, while the maximum longevity recorded is 26 years for females and 21.5 years for males (McIntosh 2007). Age-specific survival probabilities are high (0.98) after six years of age and are similar for males and females (McIntosh 2007).Australian Sea Lions are unique among pinnipeds, being the only species that has a non-annual breeding cycle, with intervals between pupping seasons of ~17–18 months (Ling and Walker 1978, Higgins and Gass 1993, Shaughnessy et al. 2006, Goldsworthy et al. 2014). Furthermore, breeding seasons are protracted in duration (4-9 months), and occur asynchronously across the species range (breeding can occur at any time of the year) (Shaughnessy et al. 2006, Goldsworthy et al. 2014). Asynchronous breeding is maintained through extremely low rates of interchange between colonies by adult females, as demonstrated by genetic studies that indicate extreme population sub-structuring of mitochondrial DNA lineages (maternally inherited), even for those separated by short distances (Campbell et al. 2008, Goldsworthy and Lowther 2010, Lowther et al. 2012). The evolutionary determinants of this unusual reproductive strategy remain enigmatic (Goldsworthy et al. 2009). Given the high level of genetic subdivision at the breeding colony scale, individual breeding colonies are considered subpopulations in this species (Campbell et al. 2008, Lowther 2010, Lowther et al. 2012).The low synchrony of births within a breeding season requires males to mate-guard individual females until they come into oestrus around 7–10 days following the birth of the pup. Males are therefore sequentially polygynous, mate-guarding individual females until the male is compelled to go to sea and forage, after which he returns and repeats the strategy. Males defend their female(s) with guttural clicking, growling and barking vocalizations, posturing, and by fighting with rivals.  Like most pinnipeds, there is a 4–6 month period of delayed implantation of the blastocyst following conception. This leads to a prolonged (active) placental gestation of up to 14 months, the longest for any pinniped (Gales and Costa 1997). The annual pregnancy rate of mature females is ~71 % (Higgins and Gass 1993).Pups are continuously attended for the first 9–10 days after birth by their mother, after which adult females alternate between foraging trips to sea and nursing bouts ashore. Females nurse their pups for 15–18 months, usually weaning them before giving birth again, however females will nurse offspring for three or more years if they do not pup in the subsequent breeding season or their new pup dies. Adult female Australian Sea Lions behave aggressively toward pups that are not their own. Pups will play at the shoreline and in tide pools while their mothers are away, and following their postnatal moult, will actively swim on their own. Pups commence their own foraging trips at a young age and by six months can occupy part of adult female home range and explore adult foraging habitat at least eight months prior to weaning, allowing them to learn the location of suitable foraging habitat and the skills required to hunt successfully (Lowther and Goldsworthy 2012).Australian Sea Lions restrict their foraging activities to continental shelf waters, with juveniles, adult females and adult males rarely exceeding depths of 90, 130, and 150 m, respectively (Goldsworthy et al. 2010). The maximum recorded dive depth for an adult male is ~250 m (Goldsworthy unpublished data). The maximum recorded foraging ranges of juvenile and adult female seals are 118 and 190 km, respectively (Goldsworthy et al. 2010). Adult males range much further and have been tracked up to 340 km from their colony. There is marked within and between-colony variability in the foraging behaviour of juveniles, adult females, and males (Goldsworthy et al. 2009, Goldsworthy et al. 2010, Lowther and Goldsworthy 2011, Lowther et al. 2012). Foraging trips to sea are relatively short compared to other otariids (mean 1.1 day and maximum 5.1 days in juveniles; mean 1.2 day and maximum 6.2 days in adult females; mean of 2.5 days and maximum 6.7 days in adult males; Higgins 1993, Higgins and Gass 1993, Lowther and Goldsworthy 2011, Kirkwood and Goldsworthy 2013). Australian Sea Lions are benthic, diurnal foragers that routinely transit to foraging locations by swimming along the bottom and dive continuously while at sea and forage at all times of day (Costa and Gales 2003). During dives they minimize the time spent during the descent and ascent phases in order to maximize foraging time on the seabed. Individual dives rarely exceed eight minutes in duration enabling animals to perform around 10–11 dives per hour (Kirkwood and Goldsworthy 2013). Australian Sea Lions are fast, powerful swimmers and often “porpoise” out of the water when moving rapidly at the surface.The diet of the Australian Sea Lion is poorly understood. Dietary information available is based on limited scat (faeces), digestive tract (autopsied dead animals), and regurgitate analyses (Gales and Cheal 1992, Ling 1992, McIntosh et al. 2006), some crittercam footage (Fragnito 2013), and analyses of prey DNA recovered from faeces (Peters et al. 2014). Cephalopods appear to be a key component of the diet, and include Octopus (Octopodidae), Squid (Loliginidae), and Cuttlefish (Sepiidae) species. Key fish taxa include Leatherjackets (Monacanthidae), Wrasse (Labridae), Flatheads (Platycephalidae), Perch (Sebastidae, Serranidae), Cods (Moridae), Mullets (Mullidae), and Nannygai/Redfish (Berycidae), Whiting (Siikginidae), Rock-ling, and Stingaree /Fiddler Ray (Urolophidae, Rhinobatidae). Small pelagic fish including Jack Mackerel, Yellowtail Scad, and Australian Sardine, have been recorded in the diet, but are not common (McIntosh et al. 2006, Peters et al. 2014). Crustaceans have also been recorded in the diet and include crabs (Stone Crab), prawns, and Rock Lobster (Jasus edwardsii) (McIntosh et al. 2006, Fragnito 2013). Crittercam data indicate that diet and feeding behaviour can vary markedly between individual animals (Fragnito 2013).Predators of Australian Sea Lions include Great White Sharks (Shaughnessy et al. 2007) and presumably Killer Whales (Ling 2002).','Although now protected, Australian Sea Lions have not rebounded fully in numbers or reoccupied all of their former range. A range of anthropogenic factors have been identified which may be impacting the recovery of the Australian Sea Lion (Goldsworthy et al. 2009, DSEWPC 2013). The cumulative impact of many of these threats may vary across the range of the species. Fisheries bycatch (especially in gillnets) and entanglement in marine debris appear to pose the greatest threat to the Australian Sea Lion at present (Shaughnessy et al. 2003, Goldsworthy and Page 2007, Goldsworthy et al. 2010), while secondary threats include: habitat degradation and interactions with aquaculture operations; human disturbance to colonies; deliberate killings; disease; chemical pollution and oil spills; noise pollution; prey depletion and competition; and climate change (Goldsworthy et al. 2009, DSEWPC 2013).

Females first haul out to pup at ages of three to six years, and males typically breed for the first time at six to ten years of age (Laws 1956, Carrick et al. 1962a, Jones 1981, McCann 1981, Pistorius et al. 2001, Kirkman et al. 2004). At Marion Island, less than 5% of females survived beyond 13 years of age, and less than 5% of males beyond 10 years of age (de Bruyn 2009). Longevity of 23 years has been recorded for adult females at Macquarie Island (Hindell and Little 1988).Southern Elephant Seals undergo an annual double migration between foraging grounds and isolated haulout sites, at which they are born and where they breed in the austral spring, moult in the austral summer, and as immatures haulout in the winter (Bartholomew and Hubbs 1960, Carrick et al. 1962b, Hindell and Burton 1988). Southern Elephant Seals are predominantly marine. Adult females spend more than 85% of each year at sea while adult males spend less than 80% (Carrick et al. 1962a, Hindell and Burton 1988, McIntyre et al. 2010). Their foraging grounds may be located over 5,000 km from their terrestrial haulout sites (Bester and Pansegrouw 1992, Jonker and Bester 1998, Campagna et al. 1999, Bailleul et al. 2007).Southern Elephant Seals spend most of their at-sea time foraging in association with frontal systems, currents and shifting marginal ice-edge zones. Studies of foraging sites suggest that they are sensitive to fine-scale variation in bathymetry and ocean properties (sea-ice concentration and sea temperature profiles) (Bailleul et al. 2007, Biuw et al. 2010). Southern Elephant Seals are prodigious divers. Dive depth and duration vary during the year and between the sexes, but mostly range from 200 to 700 m deep and from 20 to just over 30 minutes in duration (Biuw et al. 2010, McIntyre et al. 2010). Both sexes spend over 65% of their lives below 100 m. The maximum record dive depth is 2,133 m for an adult male (McIntyre et al. 2010).The diet varies between populations and seasons. It consist primarily of myctophid and notothenid fish and squid (Brown et al. 1999, Piatkowski et al. 2002, Bradshaw et al. 2003, van den Hoff et al. 2003, Cherel et al. 2008, Newland et al. 2011).Four types of terrestrial periods are experienced over the course of their lives: the breeding, moult and winter haulouts, and the natal terrestrial period. The mating system is mate-defense polygyny. Breeding seasons are highly synchronized (Carrick et al. 1962b, Laws 1956, McCann 1981, Bonner 1989). Adult females spend approximately a month ashore during the breeding season, while adult males may spend one to three months ashore. During this time adult females will haul out in large aggregations that may contain up to a thousand animals (Carrick et al. 1962a, Bonner 1989). Some three to seven days after females come ashore they give birth to a single pup, which they will suckle for some three weeks. Mating takes place shortly before the pup is weaned and the adult female returns to the sea a few days later. Breeding aggregations are ephemeral, and do not last beyond the breeding season. Access to all females in one breeding aggregation is defended by a dominant adult male. In larger breeding aggregations, subdominant males also gain access to females (Laws 1956, Carrick et al. 1962a, McCann 1981).Killer Whales are the primary predators of Southern Elephant Seals (Reisinger et al. 2011) but Leopard Seals are also known to take pups (Gwyn 1953).','Southern Elephant Seals face few threats and conflicts today, since they live far from human population centres and have minimal interactions with commercial fisheries. Intensive fishing could, however, deplete important prey stocks (Hanchet et al. 2003). The possible effects of global climate change on Southern Elephant Seals are not well known but such changes may negatively impact prey populations or change marine habitat (Learmonth et al. 2006, Kovacs et al. 2012). It is also possible that a reduction in sea ice due to climate change may benefit Southern Elephant Seals (van den Hoff et al. 2014). Southern Elephant Seals that haul out at mainland sites could come in contact with domestic and wild animals and be exposed to a variety of diseases including morbilliviruses (Lavigne and Schmitz 1990).'),(28,'Dugong dugon','Dugong','Vulnerable','Listed','mammals','Dugongidae','Sirenia','Mammalia','Chordata','Animalia','http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=28',0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,2024,'decreasing','Habitat requirements for Dugongs include coastal areas, shallow to medium deep, warm waters (15-17°C minimum with behavioural thermoregulation), seagrass beds supporting sub-tropical and tropical species of seagrass, particularly low fiber species (Hines et al. 2012, Marsh et al. 2011). Dugongs show great variability in movement patterns and migration, depending on the study area and the influence of seasonal temperature or rainfall on regional ecosystems. Long-distance movements by Dugongs along the Queensland coast are well-documented (Sheppard et al. 2006), even though Dugongs do not appear to undertake regular migrations and individual movements are individualistic (Sheppard et al. 2006, Marsh et al. 2011, Gredzens et al. 2014). Cope et al. (2015) used pedigree analysis based on individual genetic markers to infer the movements of Dugongs between locations in southeast Queensland including Moreton Bay and Hervey Bay. They found that approximately 30% of assigned parents had at least one offspring found in a different locality, implying recent movement of the parent or offspring. This analysis suggested markedly more movement between localities than detected through repeated direct sampling of individuals (Seddon et al. 2014) or through telemetry (Sheppard et al. 2006).','Threats to Dugongs vary between different populations as detailed in Marsh et al. (2011) and Hines et al. (2012). Major threats include:Incidental capture in fishing gear (e.g. gill nets), shark nets for bather protection, IUU fishing especially if meat is subsequently sold (see Pilcher et al. 2014, for a detailed rapid assessment based on questionnaires to provide information on conservation hotpots for Dugongs in 18 countries in four geographic areas: Pacific, Southeast Asia, South Asia and East Africa, with 6,153 respondents)Hunting: legal (i.e. culturally sanctioned) and illegalBoat strikes and boating activities (e.g. acoustic pollution)Damage/modification/loss of habitat caused by human settlement on coasts, shipping, trawling destructive fishing, natural processes (e.g. cyclones and tsunamis)Threats to seagrass (including untreated sewage disposal, coastal dredging and reclamation, inshore commercial trawling, agricultural pollution)Chemical pollution (e.g. oil spills and heavy metal loads)Climate change (extreme weather events and high temperatures)The major drivers for incidental capture in fishing gear and illegal hunting are poverty and declining fish stocks. Dugongs are legally protected in most of their range. However, enforcement is typically weak or non-existent. The imperative of artisanal fishers to break the law is increased by the opportunity to sell both Dugong meat (Robards and Reeves 2011) and valuable commodities such as swim bladders and shark fins (Marsh et al. 2011). Artisanal coastal and riverine fisheries are vital to the livelihoods and food security of coastal peoples, especially in the tropics (Batista et al. 2014), including most Dugong range states. On a global scale, such fisheries catch the same amount of fish for human consumption as commercial fisheries, yet employ some 25 times the number of fishers (over 12 million people; Chuenpagdee et al. 2008, Batista et al. 2014). Gill nets are significant threat to many marine mammals including dugongs (Read et al. 2006, Moore et al. 2010, Pilcher et al. 2014). Some Dugong declines coincide with the introduction of monofilament nylon gill nets (Muir and Kizka 2012). However, it is often very difficult to convince the fishers or the fisheries managers to take the capture of Dugongs seriously. When Dugong population sizes are low, their capture in fisheries is a rare event, which becomes rarer as the Dugong population declines. Coastal development represents another important driver. Significant seagrass loss leads to Dugongs having reduced food resources, delayed reproduction and starvation (Marsh et al. 2011). The impact of chemical and noise pollution on Dugongs is unquantified. (Marsh et al. 2011).Climate change is projected to lead to altered coastal environmental condition and increases in severe tropical storms and flood events that could affect both Dugongs and their seagrass habitats exacerbating the effects of the other drivers listed above (see Marsh et al. 2011 for details).'),(66236,'Hippocampus histrix','Spiny Seahorse, Thorny Seahorse','Vulnerable','Listed','fishes','Syngnathidae','Syngnathiformes','Actinopterygii','Chordata','Animalia','http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=66236',0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,2024,'decreasing','Hippocampus histrix is found at depths between 10 and 40 m but may also be found deeper than this (Lourie 2016). This species is found on a variety of substrates including sponges, weedy rocky reefs, soft corals, and seagrass beds (Lourie et al. 2004, Kuiter 2000, Lourie 2016). Little is known about feeding, but this species likely consumes small  benthic and/or planktonic crustaceans such as harpacticoid and cyclopoid  copepods, gammarid shrimps, and mysids (Woods et al. 2002, Kendrick and Hyndes 2005, Kitsos et al. 2008, Yip et al. 2015, Valladares et al. 2016).  Seahorses including H. histrix are ovoviviparous and the males give birth to live young (Foster and Vincent 2004). The species reaches a maximum size of 17 cm, has a gestation period of 12-14 days, and matures at around 10 cm (Masuda et al. 1984). All seahorse species have vital parental care, and many species studied to date have high site fidelity (Perante et al. 2002, Foster and Vincent 2004), highly structured social behaviour (Vincent and Sadler 1995), and relatively sparse distributions (Lourie et al. 1999) - all traits which make seahorses vulnerable to exploitation. There are however some traits, such as small body size, fast growth and high fecundity that may make seahorses more resilient to exploitation (Morgan 2007). However a specialised life-history coupled with a dependence on shallow habitats that are subject to extremely high fishing pressure, and the fact that seahorses do not move very much and are thus easily captured, means they are very vulnerable to over-exploitation. The importance of life history parameters in determining response to exploitation has been demonstrated for a number of species, including seahorses (Jennings et al. 1998, Foster and Vincent 2004).','The major threat to Hippocampus histrix is over-exploitation. This species is caught in both targeted fisheries and as bycatch in other non-selective fisheries, particularly shrimp trawls (McPherson and Vincent 2004, Meeuwig et al. 2006, Perry et al. 2010). H. histrix has been reported in international trade since the mid 1990s and even at this stage, interviews with fishers and traders reported declines in the availability of seahorses (McPherson and Vincent 2004, Perry et al. 2010). Although daily catch rates on individual vessels are quite low, the cumulative impact of the Indo-Pacific trawl fleet leaves little doubt that byactach is affecting populations of this species (Vincent et al. 2011, Lawson et al. 2017).  This species\' coastal seagrass and coral habitats are threatened throughout its range by eutrophication, sedimentation, coastal construction, dredging, destructive fishing practices such as trawling and dynamite use, and climate change (Carpenter et al. 2008, Normile et al. 2016, Short et al. 2011).Seahorses have a life history and ecological traits that may increase their susceptibility to these threats (see Habitats and Ecology).'),(66239,'Hippocampus spinosissimus','Hedgehog Seahorse','Vulnerable','Listed','fishes','Syngnathidae','Syngnathiformes','Actinopterygii','Chordata','Animalia','http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=66239',0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,2024,'decreasing','Hippocampus spinosissimus are found in reef systems, occupying silt/sand bottoms (Lourie et al. 2004).

Malaysian trawls containing H. spinosissimus also captured similar substrates (Choo and Liew 2003). This species is often found at depths deeper than 8 m with a maximum reported depth of 70 m (Lourie et al. 2004, Morgan and Panes 2008).

In Port Stephens, it has been shown that juveniles prefer gorgonian habitats (Euplexaura sp.) whilst adults had a preference for both sponges and soft coral (Dendronephthya australis) habitats. They were also found occurring in Posidonia seagrass and juveniles also used Sargassum sp. and soft coral habitats (Carijoa sp. and D. australis) (Harasti et al. 2014a). They are known to show a preference for more complex habitats, as it is believed that this provides better protection and more food resources (Hellyer et al. 2011, Harasti et al. 2014a).Burchmore et al. (1984) reported that the species consumes amphipods, but did not elaborate. Most seahorses feed on a variety of small crustaceans, including harpacticoid, caprellid, and cyclopoid copepods, gammarid amphipods, caridean shrimp, and mysids (Woods 2002, Kendrick and Hyndes 2005, Kitsos et al. 2008, Yip et al. 2014).As is the case for other seahorses, Hippocampus whitei are ovoviviparous, and males brood the young in a pouch prior to giving live birth (Foster and Vincent 2004). They breed from October to April. Within this breeding season, they are site-faithful to a home range (averaging 8 m² for males, 12 m² for females: Vincent et al. 2005) and are faithful to a single mate (Vincent and Sadler 1995).The species is known to display strong site fidelity with tagged males occurring on the same site for up to 56 months and females 49 months, whilst no seahorses were ever recorded moving between sites. The species is known not to move far, as the largest distance a tagged animal was found to travel was only 70 m. It has also been shown that individuals show strong fidelity to holdfasts such as sponges, with some individuals being recorded on the same holdfast for up to 17 months (Harasti et al. 2014a).Within Sydney Harbour, seahorses are generally found on artificial habitats such as the protective swimming net enclosures and also on jetty pylons. Their use of these artificial habitats is most likely driven by a loss of natural habitats (such as seagrass, sponges and soft corals) within Sydney Harbour. Seagrass habitats within Sydney Harbour have been shown to decline (West et al. 2004) and anecdotal information suggests large declines in available soft coral and sponge habitats.Growth parameters for Port Stephens were: females L∞ = 149.2 mm and K= 2.034 per year and males L∞ = 147.9 mm and K=2.520 per year compared to estimates from Sydney Harbour:  females L∞ = 139.8 mm and K= 1.285 per year and males L∞ = 141.6 mm and K=1.223 per year (Harasti et al. 2012).Hippocampus whitei displays rapid growth, early maturity and reproduction (Harasti et al. 2012), indicating that it has the ability to develop large populations if conditions are appropriate, such as the availability of suitable habitat and few predators (Harasti et al. 2014b). However, the species has very limited chance for dispersal given that there is no pelagic stage for juveniles, with newborns generally settling in the area of birth and not travelling far (Harasti et al. 2014a). Even though the life-history parameters of H. whitei suggest it may be reasonably resilient, precaution should be taken in its future management as a result of its limited geographical distribution and increasing pressures from anthropogenic sources on its habitats.Although generation length is unknown, the species is thought to be similar to other seahorses in having a generation length of approximately one year. Therefore declines are assessed over a 10-year period for this species, which is thought to be longer than three generation lengths.','The major threat to Hippocampus whitei is loss of essential marine habitats across its range. This species is known to occur along some of the most heavily populated and impacted estuaries in Australia (NSW EPA 2012). As the species displays strong site fidelity and has specific habitat preferences (Vincent et al. 2005, Harasti et al. 2014a), the further loss of key habitats through anthropogenic effects would result in a negative effect on species abundance and distribution; as occurred in Port Stephens (Harasti 2016). Whilst the Port Stephens estuary was previously considered a ‘stronghold’ for populations of H. whitei, the recent population declines as a result of habitat loss indicates that its long-term conservation within the Port Stephens waterway is at risk if essential marine habitats continue to be lost.Within Sydney Harbour, it has been shown that H. whitei are very susceptible to councils cleaning the nets as removal of epibiota caused a decrease in abundance and that the species showed significant avoidance of areas devoid of epibiotic growth (Harasti et al. 2010). Guidelines for cleaning of the nets to minimise harm to the seahorses were developed and provided to councils in 2009 (Harasti et al. 2010); however, councils rarely implement these guidelines.'),(1768,'Dermochelys coriacea','Leatherback Turtle, Leathery Turtle, Luth','Endangered','Listed','reptiles','Dermochelyidae','Testudines','Reptilia','Chordata','Animalia','http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1768',0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2024,'decreasing','D. coriacea is an oceanic, deep-diving marine turtle inhabiting tropical, subtropical, and subpolar seas. Leatherbacks make extensive migrations between different feeding areas at different seasons, and to and from nesting areas. Leatherbacks feed predominantly on jellyfishes, salps and siphonophores. Females usually produce several (3-10) clutches of 60-90 eggs in a reproductive season, and typically have a re-migration interval of multiple years (2+) between subsequent reproductive seasons. For a thorough review of Leatherback biology, please see Eckert et al. (2012).  ','Threats to Leatherbacks vary in time and space, and in relative impact to populations. Threat categories affecting marine turtles, including Leatherbacks, were described by Wallace et al. (2011) as:  1) Fisheries bycatch: incidental capture of marine turtles in fishing gear targeting other species;  2) Take: direct utilization of turtles or eggs for human use (i.e. consumption, commercial products);  3) Coastal Development affecting critical turtle habitat: human-induced alteration of coastal environments due to construction, dredging, beach modification, etc.;  4) Pollution and Pathogens: marine pollution and debris that affect marine turtles (i.e. through ingestion or entanglement, disorientation caused by artificial lights), as well as impacts of pervasive pathogens (e.g. fibropapilloma virus) on turtle health;  5) Climate change: current and future impacts from climate change on marine turtles and their habitats (e.g. increasing sand temperatures on nesting beaches affecting hatchling sex ratios, sea level rise, storm frequency and intensity affecting nesting habitats, etc.).  	The relative impacts of individual threats to all Leatherback subpopulations were assessed by Wallace et al. (2011). Fisheries bycatch was classified as the highest threat to Leatherbacks globally, followed by human consumption of Leatherback eggs, meat, or other products, and coastal development. Due to lack of information, pollution and pathogens was only scored as affecting three subpopulations and climate change was only scored for two subpopulations. Enhanced efforts to assess and reduce the impacts of these threats on Leatherbacks—and other marine turtle species—should be a high priority for future conservation efforts. '),(1765,'Chelonia mydas','Green Turtle','Vulnerable','Listed','reptiles','Cheloniidae','Testudines','Reptilia','Chordata','Animalia','http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1765',0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2024,'decreasing','Like most sea turtles, green turtles are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (for review see Hirth 1997). Upon leaving the nesting beach, it has been hypothesized that hatchlings begin an oceanic phase (Carr 1987), perhaps floating passively in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-ocean developmental grounds (Carr and Meylan 1980, Witham 1991). After a number of years in the oceanic zone, these turtles recruit to neritic developmental areas rich in seagrass and/or marine algae where they forage and grow until maturity (Musick and Limpus 1997). Upon attaining sexual maturity green turtles commence breeding migrations between foraging grounds and nesting areas that are undertaken every few years (Hirth 1997). Migrations are carried out by both males and females and may traverse oceanic zones, often spanning thousands of kilometres (Carr 1986, Mortimer and Portier 1989). During non-breeding periods adults reside at coastal neritic feeding areas that sometimes coincide with juvenile developmental habitats (e.g., Limpus et al. 1994, Seminoff et al. 2003).','Green turtles, like other sea turtle species, are particularly susceptible to population declines because of their vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts during all life-stages: from eggs to adults. Perhaps the most detrimental human threats to green turtles are the intentional harvests of eggs and adults from nesting beaches and juveniles and adults from foraging grounds. Unfortunately, harvest remains legal in several countries despite substantial subpopulation declines (e.g., Humphrey and Salm 1996, Fleming 2001, Fretey 2001). In addition, a number of incidental threats impact green turtles around the world. These threats affect both terrestrial and marine environments, and include bycatch in marine fisheries, habitat degradation at nesting beaches and feeding areas, and disease. Mortality associated with entanglement in marine fisheries is the primary incidental threat; the responsible fishing techniques include drift netting, shrimp trawling, dynamite fishing, and long-lining. Degradation of both nesting beach habitat and marine habitats also play a role in the decline of many Green Turtle stocks. Nesting habitat degradation results from the construction of buildings, beach armouring and re-nourishment, and/or sand extraction (Lutcavage et al. 1997). These factors may directly, through loss of beach habitat, or indirectly, through changing thermal profiles and increasing erosion, serve to decrease the quantity and quality of nesting area available to females, and may evoke a change in the natural behaviours of adults and hatchlings (Ackerman 1997). The presence of lights on or adjacent to nesting beaches alters the behaviour of nesting adults (Witherington 1992) and is often fatal to emerging hatchlings as they are attracted to light sources and drawn away from the water (Witherington and Bjorndal 1990). Habitat degradation in the marine environment results from increased effluent and contamination from coastal development, construction of marinas, increased boat traffic, and harvest of nearshore marine algae resources. Combined, these impacts diminish the health of coastal marine ecosystems and may, in turn, adversely affect green turtles. For example, degradation of marine habitats has been implicated in the increasing prevalence of the tumour-causing Fibropapilloma disease (George 1997).'),(1766,'Eretmochelys imbricata','Hawksbill Turtle','Vulnerable','Listed','reptiles','Cheloniidae','Testudines','Reptilia','Chordata','Animalia','http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1766',0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,2024,'decreasing','HabitatsHawksbills nest on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the tropics and subtropics. They are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (for review see Witzell 1983). Available data indicate that newly emerged hatchlings enter the sea and are carried by offshore currents into major gyre systems where they remain until reaching a carapace length of some 20 to 30 cm. At that point they recruit into a neritic developmental foraging habitat that may comprise coral reefs or other hard bottom habitats, sea grass, algal beds, or mangrove bays and creeks (Musick and Limpus 1997) or mud flats (R. von Brandis unpubl. data). As they increase in size, immature Hawksbills typically inhabit a series of developmental habitats, with some tendency for larger turtles to inhabit deeper sites (van Dam and Diez 1997, Bowen et al. 2007). Once sexually mature, they undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and breeding areas at intervals of several years (Witzell 1983, Dobbs et al. 1999, Mortimer and Bresson 1999). Global population genetic studies have demonstrated the tendency of female sea turtles to return to breed at their natal rookery (Bowen and Karl 1997), even though as juveniles they may have foraged at developmental habitats located hundreds or thousands of kilometers from the natal beach. While Hawksbills undertake long migrations, some portion of immature animals may settle into foraging habitats near their beaches of origin (Bowen et al. 2007).Roles in the Ecosystem  Like other species of sea turtles, Hawksbills contribute to marine and coastal food webs and transport nutrients within the oceans (Bouchard and Bjorndal 2000). Hawksbills are important components of healthy coral reef ecosystems and are primarily spongivorous in the Caribbean (Meylan 1988), but more omnivorous in the Indo-Pacific (review by Bjorndal 1997). They consume relatively large amounts of algae in northern Australia (Whiting 2000 cited in S. Whiting in litt. to J. Mortimer 4 Jun 2007), soft corals in the Great Barrier Reef region (C. Limpus unpublished data), and other combinations of forage depending on habitat (in Seychelles, J. Mortimer and R. von Brandis unpublished data; in Barbados, B. Krueger unpublished data). At sites where they are primarily spongivorous, Hawksbills have been found to support healthy reefs by controlling sponges which would otherwise out-compete reef-building corals for space (Hill 1998, León and Bjorndal 2002, Bjorndal and Jackson 2003).','Threats: The most important threats to Hawksbill turtles, described here, are dealt with in greater detail in the section entitled Regional Overview (see Supplementary Material).Tortoiseshell Trade. Recent and historical tortoiseshell trade statistics are key to understanding the enormous and enduring effect that trade has had on Hawksbill populations around the world (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material). Within the last 100 years, millions of Hawksbills have been killed for the tortoiseshell markets of Europe, the United States and Asia. The global plight of the Hawksbill in the latter half of the 20th Century has been recognized by the inclusion of the species in the most threatened category of IUCN’s Red List since 1968 and the listing of all Hawksbill populations on Appendix I of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, since 1977. Nevertheless, trade continued at exceptionally high levels for years as major trading countries acceded to CITES and Japan, the world’s largest consumer of bekko (tortoiseshell), continued to import shell under a CITES reservation (exception) until 1993. During the period 1950-1992, Japan’s bekko imports were the equivalent of 1,329,044 large turtles (1,408,787 kg). Conservatively estimating that 30% of the turtles taken for the trade were nesting females, nearly 400,000 adult female Hawksbills were killed for the Japanese market in those years, a time frame that approximates a single Hawksbill generation. Significant domestic trade in Hawksbill products continues to be a major problem in many countries and, despite international and domestic prohibitions and the lessening of the volume in the last decade, trade remains an ongoing and pervasive threat in the Americas and southeast Asia (Fleming 2001, Chacón 2002, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004, van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, Brautigam and Eckert 2006).Egg Collection. Intense levels of egg exploitation continue in many parts of the world (see IND-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material), especially southeast Asia, where it approaches 100% in many areas (see PAC-Tables 4 and 5 in Supplementary Material).Slaughter for Meat. Adult and juvenile Hawksbills are still killed for meat in many areas (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).  In some places the meat is used by fishermen as shark bait (J. Mortimer unpubl. data, C. Lagueux, unpubl. data). Fishermen who target lobster and reef fish will commonly take whatever hawksbills they encounter (Carr and Meylan 1980).Destruction of Nesting Habitat. Tropical coastlines are rapidly being developed for tourism which often leads to destruction of nesting habitat (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material). Because Hawksbills prefer to nest under vegetation they are particularly impacted by beach-front development and clearing of dune vegetation. Daytime nesting Hawksbills in the Western Indian Ocean are particular sensitive to disturbance from human activity on the coast and in nearshore waters (Mortimer 2004). In other parts of the world such as the Middle East and Western Australia gas and oil refineries seriously disrupt nesting habitat (see IND-Table 5 and PAC-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).Destruction of Foraging Habitat. Hawksbills are typically associated with coral reefs, which are among the world’s most endangered marine ecosystems (Wilkinson 2000). Climate change has led to massive coral bleaching events with permanent consequences for local habitats (Sheppard 2006) (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).Hybridisation of Hawksbills with Other Species. At certain sites where Hawksbill numbers are particularly low, they regularly hybridise with other species of sea turtles (see ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).Entanglement and Ingestion of Marine Debris - including Fishing Gear. Hawkbills are particularly susceptible to entanglement in gill nets (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material) and capture on fishing hooks (Mortimer 1998). Juvenile Hawksbills comprised 47% of all turtles entangled in derelict fishing nets and other debris in northern Australian waters (Kiessling 2003, White 2004). Ingestion of marine debris by Hawksbills is also significant (White 2004).Oil Pollution. There is evidence oil pollution has a greater impact on Hawksbills than on other species of turtle (Meylan and Redlow 2006). In some parts of the world (especially the Middle East) oil pollution is a major problem (see IND-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).Tortoiseshell Trade OverviewHistory of the TradeTortoiseshell, the beautiful scutes of the carapace and plastron of the Hawksbill turtle, has been prized since ancient times. Surrounded by legend, tortoiseshell has been described as “one of the romantic articles of commerce, not only because of where it comes from, but because of the creatures from which it is obtained and the people engaged in the trade” (quoted in Parsons 1972). Jewellery and other tortoiseshell objects have been unearthed from pre-dynastic graves of the Nubian rulers of Egypt and excavated from the ruins of the Han Empire which ruled China in pre-Christian times. Over 2,000 years ago Julius Caesar considered the warehouses of Alexandria brimming with tortoiseshell to be the chief spoil of his triumph. By the early years of the 9th Century, caravans of Arab traders carried rhinoceros horn, ivory, and tortoiseshell throughout the Indian Ocean. For the next 1,000 years, the tortoiseshell trade flourished (Parsons 1972). Around 1700, during the Edo Period, the bekko (tortoiseshell) artisans of Japan established themselves at Nagasaki (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987).The tortoiseshell trade has been closely linked to European discovery, conquest, and commerce around the world. The Portuguese, Dutch, French and English played major roles in the global trade; exploitation occurred throughout the world’s tropical oceans, and especially in the East Indies (i.e., modern day India, Indo China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines). The East Indies were a major source of the shell of antiquity, and these rich waters fittingly have been called the world’s most productive seas for tortoiseshell (Parsons 1972). In the insular Pacific international trade did not develop until the mid 19th Century, but once established, it took a tremendous toll on the region’s Hawksbills. For the next 150 years, tortoiseshell was a prized commodity in the Pacific, first with the sandal-wooders and then with the whalers (McKinnon 1975).European Hawksbill fishing in the Caribbean began in the mid-17th Century and intensified throughout the 18th Century as demand increased (McClenachan et al. 2006). As they decimated local Hawksbill populations in one area after another, turtle fishermen moved from one site to the next. The plentiful Hawksbill resources of Central America were exploited for more than 100 years by traders, including Americans, who established the town of Bocas del Toro on the coast of Panama in 1826 (Parsons 1972). Turtling was still a lucrative business in Cuba in 1885 when the village of Cocodrilos on the Isle of Pines was settled by turtle fishermen who emigrated from the Cayman Islands after its Hawksbills were gone (Carrillo et al. 1999). Over the next 100 years, many tens of thousands of Hawksbills were captured in the rich foraging grounds of the Cuban shelf.20th Century TradeTortoiseshell trade statistics are key to understanding the enormous and enduring effect that trade has had on Hawksbill populations around the world.  In the early 20th Century, tortoiseshell was imported for luxury markets in Europe, the United States and Asia as the manufacture of combs and brushes, jewellery boxes, and tortoiseshell ornaments was “an established industry in almost every civilized country” (Seale 1917). Declines in Hawksbill populations were obvious in many areas by the first part of the century, as exemplified by expressions of “wanton destruction” in the Virgin Islands (Schmidt 1916) and over exploitation in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) (Dammerman 1929). Although existing records document an extensive trade in many countries, such as the 8,000 Hawksbills (8,000 kg) taken annually in the Philippines for the shell trade to Japan during World War I (Seale 1917) and 160,700 Hawksbills killed between 1918-1927 in the Dutch East Indies for export to Japan, Singapore and the Netherlands (Dammerman 1929), records for many other areas are incomplete.During the 20th century, Japan was the world’s largest importer of tortoiseshell (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Although data are not available for imports in the first half of the century, Japanese statistics document the import of shell equivalent to more than 1.3 million large Hawksbills from around the world between 1950-1992 and more than 575,000 stuffed juveniles from Asia between 1970-1986 (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Local trade in stuffed Hawksbills also flourished in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific and the Americas, especially in tourist areas. When Japanese, European, American and other Asian imports are considered along with the large quantities of tortoiseshell used locally in places like Sri Lanka and Madagascar, it is readily apparent that some millions of Hawksbills were killed for the tortoiseshell trade in the last 100 years.Hawksbills and CITES   In 1975, in recognition of its threatened status, the Hawksbill was included on Appendices I (Atlantic population) and II (Pacific population) of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, when the Convention came into force. By 1977 the entire species was moved to Appendix I to prohibit all international trade. Nevertheless, the global trade continued for a number of years, in large part driven by Japanese demand. At the end of 1992, Japanese imports ceased, but the industry continues to operate with stockpiled material.In the late 1970s more than 45 countries were involved in exporting and importing raw shell, with annual Japanese imports the equivalent of about 37,700 turtles (40,000 kg).Export and import levels remained exceptionally high until the mid-1980s as major trading nations slowly joined CITES. When they acceded to CITES in 1978, France and Italy took reservations (exceptions) to the Appendix I Hawksbill listing; these reservations were withdrawn in 1984 when they joined the EU.When Japan acceded to CITES in 1980, it also took a reservation on the Hawksbill and reduced its annual quota to the equivalent of 28,300 turtles (30,000 kg), based solely on the needs of its bekko industry.In 1985 CITES proposals by Indonesia and the Seychelles to place their Hawksbill populations on Appendix II to allow trade failed at the 5th CITES Conference of the Parties (COP 5). A similar Indonesian proposal at COP 6 in 1987 was withdrawn before the vote.A comprehensive report on the Japanese sea turtle trade by Milliken and Tokunaga in 1987 documented significant amounts of bekko trade with CITES countries. From 1980 to 1985, between 42% and 58% of all bekko imports originated in CITES countries, without proper export documents.In 1989 a detailed report commissioned by the CITES Secretariat found that Hawksbill populations were depleted or declining in 56 of 65 geopolitical units for which data were available and estimated that the annual global nesting population was a minimum of 15,000-25,000 Hawksbills. The authors concluded that the listing of the species on Appendix I was “unquestionably appropriate and must be maintained” (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989).On 1 April 1990, Japan reduced its annual bekko quota to the equivalent of 18,870 turtles (20,000 kg,).  In 1991, in an effort to avoid a U.S. embargo of its fish and fishery products, Japan agreed to further reduce its annual quota to the equivalent of 7,075 turtles (7,500 kg) by August 1991, to establish a zero quota on 1 January 1993, and to drop its Hawksbill reservation in July 1994. Japan also agreed to support the re-training of hundreds of bekko artisans. In the early 1990s, in response to the end of the Japanese trade, Cuba reduced its annual Hawksbill fishery quota from 5,000 turtles to 500.Since 1994, officials in Seychelles and Zanzibar have acquired tortoiseshell stocks from local artisans and subsequently burned them to demonstrate a commitment to ending the tortoiseshell trade (Khatib et al. 1996, Mortimer 1999). Cape Verde has shown similar commitment (Fretey et al. 2002).In 1997 and 2000, at CITES COP 10 and COP 11, Cuba proposed to sell its stockpiled tortoiseshell to Japan, and also proposed a continuation of the international trade in tortoiseshell taken from the 500 Hawksbills still captured each year. All these proposals failed.In response to regional disagreement generated by Cuban interest in moving Caribbean Hawksbills from Appendix I to II, the CITES Secretariat convened two regional Hawksbill dialogues in 2001 and 2002. The Dialogues encouraged regional cooperation by helping to establish Hawksbill priorities. As a result, resources for research, management and conservation have been generated.Although the tortoiseshell trade continues to threaten Hawksbills in numerous places, overall volume is substantially reduced. Thirty years after CITES came into force, the ban on international trade demonstrates its value over time in protecting Hawksbills. Above all, nesting increases in the Caribbean coincide with the enormous reduction in Hhawksbill fishing in Cuban waters.In June 2007, Cuba informed CITES COP 14 that it would voluntarily institute a moratorium on its sea turtle fisheries in 2008. Although Cuba has a CITES Hawksbill reservation (exception) and reserves its right to dispose of its tortoiseshell stockpile, most nations are members of CITES and therefore cannot legally trade in tortoiseshell.The Japanese Tortoiseshell TradeTwenty years ago, in their landmark report on Japan’s sea turtle trade, Milliken and Tokunaga (1987) focused on providing estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills (and other species of sea turtles) represented by trade data so that the effect of Japanese exploitation around the world could be assessed. In particular, they cautioned that past exploitation is relevant to understanding and predicting current sea turtle population trends.Estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills involved in the tortoiseshell trade are based on conversion factors calculated for each region by Milliken and Tokunaga (1987). Globally, the average Hawksbill produces 1.06 kg of tortoiseshell; but regionally, conversions are 0.74 kg in the Indian Ocean; 0.75 kg in Asia; 0.88 kg in Oceania; and 1.34 kg in the Caribbean. A combination of factors likely accounts for these differences, including regional variation in average adult size, as well as the relative proportion of adult and immature turtles represented in the trade. Some reports indicate that in the past the average turtle produced more shell than in recent decades. Adult turtles that survive long enough will continue to grow, so it follows that the average size of nesting animals tends to decline in an over-exploited population. In other cases, once nesting populations have been destroyed, hunters may shift their focus to foraging turtles which usually include immature animals. In the absence of specific historical information documenting the size classes of animals killed, the conversions we use in the present assessment are based on estimates provided by Milliken and Tokunaga. Based on the trade through 1992 (when legal Japanese imports ceased), the following information reveals the extent of the Japanese exploitation of global Hawksbill populations and the percent contribution of different regions to overall imports during 1950-1992.Caribbean and Latin America (44.2%): 29 countries provided the shell of 460,220 turtles (616,695 kg). Exports from Panama and Cuba were the equivalent of 152,070 and 106,948 turtles (203,774 kg and 170,047 kg, respectively), making them the most important sources of bekko in the world for Japan. Panama hosted the region’s largest nesting Hawksbill assemblages until the latter part of the 20th Century. After 1961, Hawksbills in the Cuban trade were captured only at sea, but comprised adult and large immature animals.Asia (20.8%): nine countries provided the shell of 387,020 turtles (290,265 kg). Exports from Indonesia were the equivalent of 155,654 turtles (116,741 kg), making it the most important source in the region and the third largest global supplier to Japan. Much of the shell exported from Singapore to Japan was probably of Indonesian origin (118,535 turtles, 88,901 kg). Asia was nearly the sole source of Japan’s stuffed juvenile Hawksbill imports, as discussed below.North America (15.1%): the United States provided Japan with the shell of 199,490 turtles (211,463 kg) in two very large shipments, 142,241 kg in 1951 and 68,402 in 1954. The countries of origin are unknown, but in all likelihood some quantity originated in U.S. Caribbean and Pacific territories.Indian Ocean and East Africa (8.7%): 15 countries provided the shell of 164,828 turtles (121,973 kg). Kenya and Tanzania, regional collection points, were the major exporters. Countries in the northwestern Indian Ocean are notably absent from Japanese import statistics. As a non-CITES country, Maldives figured prominently in the trade after 1984 despite its national legislation protecting Hawksbills. Japanese imports therefore were in contravention of CITES Conf. Res. 4.25, which requires a nation with a reservation to treat an Appendix I species as Appendix II, with valid export documents from the country of origin.Oceania (5.8%): six countries provided the shell of 92,124 turtles (81,069 kg). A significant proportion of this trade is attributed to Australia until 1977 (29,109 turtles; 25,616 kg). Solomon Islands and Fiji were also important suppliers, especially in the final years of trading, with 40,982 and 14,490 turtles (36,064 and 12,751 kg, respectively). Fiji banned all tortoiseshell exports in January 1991 (Daly, 1991) but domestic tourist trade in Hawksbill curios and whole carapaces continues (see PAC-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).Europe and West Africa (5.4%): 10 countries provided the shell of 70,560 turtles (74,793 kg). The Netherlands was the largest exporter with the equivalent of 44,775 turtles (47,461 kg), but the source of this shell is unknown.In the 1970s, small lacquered Hawksbills became popular in Japan as symbols of long life. From 1970-1986 Japan imported 576,702 juvenile Hawksbills, mostly from Indonesia and Singapore but also from Taiwan, Province of China (32,075), the Ryukyus (13,438), Philippines (8698), Viet Nam (1195), Hong Kong (3549), and small quantities from a handful of other nations. Japan subsequently prohibited the trade, but continued to allow dealers to sell stocks acquired before July 1994. In December 1999, the dealers reported that they had a total of 135 stuffed sea turtles (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).Numerous irregularities in bekko imports occurred in the final years of Japan’s trade under its CITES reservation. These included imports of shell from non-CITES countries that did not legally allow export of shell, as well as imports from countries known to have had too few turtles to supply the shell attributed to them. Based on these data, Japanese bekko imports from 11 of the 14 countries reported by the dealers in 1989 were illegal.The bekko stockpile in Japan includes raw shell and finished products. After Japan banned all imports in January 1993, annual Japanese domestic sales from stockpiled supplies remained high. Between July 1995 and July 1998 the stockpile was reduced from 188.4 to 102.73 tonnes (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000). Information on subsequent annual sales and use is not available, but supplies would now be exhausted if utilization had continued at 28 tonnes a year after July 1998.Today, however, the bekko industry is intact, and Japanese consumer demand remains high. In January 2000, the valuable raw shell from abdominal plates ranged in price from JPY 30,000 per kg to JPY 150,000 per kg (US $ 294-$1470 at that time) (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).21st Century Global TradeSignificant domestic trade in Hawksbill products is a major problem in many countries and, despite prohibitions on international trade and a reduction in its volume in the last decade, international and domestic trade remains an ongoing and pervasive threat in the Americas, Asia, and parts of Africa (Fleming 2001, Chacon 2002, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004, van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, Brautigam and Eckert 2006, Reuter and Allan 2006).Some Japanese dealers have continued to import shell illegally as evidenced by numerous bekko shipments intercepted en route to or in Japan since the ban took effect (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000) and ongoing underground trade in southeast Asia to Japan and other destinations (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004).More than a decade after the Japanese prohibition on bekko imports took effect, van Dijk and Shepherd (2004) reported the interest of the Japan Bekko Association in acquiring Indonesia’s remaining stockpiles of bekko.Although the volume of trade in Indonesia diminished significantly between 1991 and 2001, it is still substantial. The collection of tortoiseshell still occurs in numerous places, with most of the trade appearing to be disorganized and underground. Western Sumatra, Nias, and Papua are areas where significant exploitation and trade are known or suspected (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004).Those familiar with the trade warn that Indonesian stockpiles should be seized “as any indication of resumption of international trade of bekko could lead to requests from Indonesian traders to be allowed to sell their stockpiles” (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004).Surveys in Viet Nam in 2002 revealed an active international trade in tortoiseshell that had increased since 1999.  Shell was purchased by tourists and foreigners buying in bulk for export to Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan (Province of China), Thailand, China and Asian communities in North America and Europe. Viet Nam subsequently instituted full protection for the Hawksbill (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, TRAFFIC East Asia 2004).In recent reviews of the Lesser Antilles, Dominican Republic, Central America, Colombia and Venezuela, researchers provided evidence of extensive clandestine trade in sea turtles, including Hawksbills.  Management and law enforcement are inadequate throughout the region (Brautigam and Eckert 2006, Reuter and Allan 2006).On 1 February 2007, the Kyodo News of Japan reported that Cuba would not seek to re-open the international tortoiseshell trade at the upcoming CITES meeting and noted Japanese disappointment given the long term support provided for the bekko industry. During 1991-2006, the Japanese government spent 735 million yen (US $6M) for research on Hawksbill resources and 140 million yen (US $1.1M) for projects to resume international trade, including trade with Cuba. The article also reported that the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry will support the bekko industry for another five years.'),(1763,'Caretta caretta','Loggerhead Turtle','Endangered','Listed','reptiles','Cheloniidae','Testudines','Reptilia','Chordata','Animalia','http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1763',0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2024,'decreasing','The Loggerhead Turtle nests on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the temperate and subtropical regions worldwide. Like most sea turtles, Loggerhead Turtles are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (Bolten and Witherington 2003). Upon leaving the nesting beach, hatchlings begin an oceanic phase in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-ocean developmental grounds (Bolten and Witherington 2003, Putman and Mansfield 2015). After 4-19 years in the oceanic zone, Loggerheads recruit to neritic developmental areas rich in benthic prey or epipelagic prey where they forage and grow until maturity at 10–39 years (Avens and Snover 2013). Upon attaining sexual maturity Loggerhead Turtles undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and nesting areas at remigration intervals of one to several years with a mean of 2.5–3 years for females (Schroeder et al. 2003) while males would have a shorter remigration interval (e.g., Hays et al. 2010, Wibbels et al. 1990). Migrations are carried out by both males and females and may traverse oceanic zones spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometres (Plotkin 2003). During non-breeding periods adults reside at coastal neritic feeding areas that sometimes coincide with juvenile developmental habitats (Bolten and Witherington 2003).Generation lengthThe IUCN Red List Criteria define generation length to be the average age of parents in a population (i.e., older than the age at maturity and younger than the oldest mature individual) and care should be taken to avoid underestimation (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). Although different subpopulations may have different generation length, since this information is limited we adopted the same value for all the subpopulations, taking care to avoid underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).Loggerheads attain maturity at 10-39 years (Avens and Snover 2013), and we considered here 30 years to be equal or greater than the average age at maturity. Data on reproductive longevity in Loggerheads are limited, but are becoming available with increasing numbers of intensively monitored, long-term projects on protected beaches. Tagging studies have documented reproductive histories up to 28 years in the North Western Atlantic Ocean (Mote Marine Laboratory, unpubl. data), up to 18 years in the South Western Indian Ocean (Nel et al. 2013), up to 32 years in the South Western Atlantic Ocean (Projeto Tamar unpubl. data), and up to 37 years in the South Western Pacific Ocean, where females nesting for 20-25 years are common (C. Limpus, pers. comm). We considered 15 years to be equal or greater than the average reproductive longevity. Therefore, we considered here 45 years to be equal or greater than the average generation length, therefore avoiding underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).','Threats to Loggerheads vary in time and space, and in relative impact to populations. Threat categories affecting marine turtles, including Loggerheads, were described by Wallace et al. (2011) as:Fisheries bycatch: incidental capture of marine turtles in fishing gear targeting other species;Take: direct utilization of turtles or eggs for human use (i.e., consumption, commercial products);Coastal Development affecting critical turtle habitat: human-induced alteration of coastal environments due to construction, dredging, beach modification, etc;Pollution and Pathogens: marine pollution and debris that affect marine turtles (i.e., through ingestion or entanglement, disorientation caused by artificial lights), as well as impacts of pervasive pathogens (for example fibropapilloma virus) on turtle health;Climate change: current and future impacts from climate change on marine turtles and their habitats (increasing sand temperatures on nesting beaches affecting hatchling sex ratios, sea level rise, storm frequency and intensity affecting nesting habitats, etc.).The relative impacts of individual threats to all Loggerhead subpopulations were assessed by by Wallace et al. (2011). Fisheries bycatch was classified as the highest threat to Loggerheads globally, followed by coastal development and human consumption of eggs, meat, or other products. Due to lack of information, pollution and pathogens was only scored as affecting three subpopulations and climate change was only scored for two subpopulations. Enhanced efforts to assess and reduce the impacts of these threats on Loggerheads—and other marine turtle species—should be a high priority for future conservation efforts. More detailed information at regional level can found in the specific subpopulation assessments.'),(1767,'Lepidochelys olivacea','Olive Ridley Turtle, Pacific Ridley Turtle','Endangered','Listed','reptiles','Cheloniidae','Testudines','Reptilia','Chordata','Animalia','http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1767',0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,2024,'decreasing','HabitatsLike most other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys display a complex life cycle, which requires a range of geographically separated localities and multiple habitats (Márquez 1990). Females lay their nests on coastal sandy beaches from which neonates emerge and enter the marine environment to continue their development. They remain in a pelagic phase, drifting passively with major currents that disperse far from their natal sites, with juveniles sharing some of the adults’ habitats (Kopitsky et al. 2000) until sexual maturity is reached (Musick and Limpus 1997). Reproductively active males and females migrate toward coastal zones and concentrate near nesting beaches. However, some males appear to remain in oceanic waters and mate with females en route to their nesting beaches (Plotkin et al. 1996, Kopitsky et al. 2000). Their post-breeding migrations are complex, with pathways varying annually (Plotkin 1994) and with no apparent migratory corridors, swimming hundreds or thousands of kilometers over large ocean expanses (Morreale et al. 2007), commonly within the 20°C isotherms (Márquez 1990). In the East Pacific, they are present from 30°N to 15°S and often seen within 1,200 nautical miles from shore although they have been sighted as far as 140°W (IATTC 2004). Western Atlantic Olive Ridleys appear to remain in neritic waters after breeding (Pritchard 1976, Reichart 1993).Demographic features / ReproductionThe species displays three modes of reproduction: arribada, dispersed nesting, and mixed strategy (Bernardo and Plotkin 2007). The first mode represents a synchronous, mass nesting behaviour that may include hundreds to thousands of females over a period of days and occurs in fewer than a dozen places worldwide. The more common form of nesting is dispersed or “solitary” with no apparent synchronicity between individual events. At some localities, a mixture of these two forms of nesting can also occur. In general, individual Olive Ridleys may nest one, two or three times per season, with approximately 100–110 eggs per clutch (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995). For this assessment we have used an average number of 2.5 nests/female/season and 105 eggs/nest. In contrast to other sea turtle species, the reproductive cycle is nearly annual (over 60% of turtles nest every year; Márquez 1990). Solitary nesters oviposit on 14 day cycles whereas arribada nesters approximately every 28 days (Pritchard 1969, Kalb and Owens 1994, Kalb 1999). Kalb (1999) found that within a nesting season solitary nesters use multiple beaches for oviposition but arribada nesters display nest site fidelity. There are extreme variations in hatching rates between nesting beaches, however, in general they are much higher in solitary nesting beaches where around 80% is common and sometimes even higher (Gaos et al. 2006). It is widely recognized that survivorship is extremely low on high-density arribada nesting beaches because of density-dependent mortality (Cornelius et al. 1991) leading to hatching rates as low as 1 to 8% (Cornelius et al. 1991). Moreover, turtles return approximately every month during a discrete nesting season (three to six months) and nests that remained intact during the previous month are again at risk when new waves of turtles crawl ashore. On solitary nesting beaches, where density-dependent mortality is not a factor, hatching rates are significantly higher (Castro 1986, Gaos et al. 2006). Post-hatching survivorship is unknown and there is no information available on recruitment rates. Presumably, like other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys experience high mortality in their early life stages. Juveniles are believed to occur in similar habitats as the adults (i.e,. pelagic waters) where they forage on gelatinous prey such as jellyfish, salps and tunicates (Kopitsky et al. 2004).','Like other long-lived species, Olive Ridleys are prone to population declines because of slow intrinsic growth rate in combination with anthropogenic impacts. These can accumulate over a protracted development through various life stages, multiple habitats (nesting beaches, migratory routes and pelagic foraging zones) and vast geographic expanses.Targeted exploitationEgg harvest. Olive Ridleys and their eggs have been harvested, mostly unsustainably, worldwide. However, the current impact is difficult to evaluate because of other simultaneous factors such as incidental take in commercial fisheries. Nonetheless, there is documentation of recent egg use causing declines (Cornelius et al. 2007). From México to Colombia, Olive Ridley eggs have been and still are used for personal and commercial use (Lagueux 1989, Arauz 2000, Campbell 2007, Cornelius et al. 2007). Laws regulating turtle egg use vary among countries, and even where laws prohibit egg use, illegal use of Olive Ridley eggs is believed to be widespread because enforcement is either non-existent or insufficient. On unprotected solitary nesting beaches (most are unprotected), egg extraction often approaches 100%. Human use of turtle eggs for consumption and domestic animal consumption historically was widespread in the Indian Ocean and continues today largely wherever Ridleys nest (Cornelius et al. 2007). Egg use has been reported in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Andaman Islands, Pakistan and Malaysia and is believed to have caused the decline of Olive Ridleys in these countries (Cornelius et al. 2007). Even at monitored beaches a proportion of the eggs are still lost to poaching.Directed take of adults. In the East Pacific, although Olive Ridley turtle fisheries are now closed, illegal take of adult turtles still occurs widely with an unknown level of impact. There is evidence that thousands of Olive Ridleys are still taken each year along the Pacific coast of México (Frazier et al. 2007). In the West Atlantic, the direct take of adults has diminished over time to negligible levels (Cornelius et al. 2007). In the Indian Ocean, the use of adult Olive Ridleys and their eggs for personal use has been and continues to be widespread (Frazier 1982, Frazier et al. 2007), and market-driven harvesting of eggs and females from nesting beaches are considered the greatest threat (Cornelius et al. 2007). Personal, subsistence use of adult Olive Ridley turtles is widespread worldwide (Cornelius et al. 2007, Frazier et al. 2007). Olive Ridleys and/or their eggs are used along the entire coast of West Africa (including Macaronesia) and sold in local and regional markets (Fretey 2001).Bycatch in fisheriesThe incidental capture of Olive Ridleys occurs worldwide in trawl fisheries, longline fisheries, purse seines, gill net and other net fisheries and hook and line fisheries (Frazier et al. 2007). The impact of the incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in fisheries has been well documented for some regions but not for others. In some locations where by-catch statistics are unavailable from fisheries, cause and effect has been used to implicate a fishery in the decline of Olive Ridleys. The incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in the shrimp trawl fishery in the western Atlantic, is believed to be the main cause of the significant population decline observed there since the 1970s and currently the number of Olive Ridleys by caught in trawl fisheries off the coasts of Surinam and French Guiana is believed to be approximately a couple of thousand turtles annually (Godfrey and Chevalier 2004, Frazier et al. 2007). Gillnets and other fishing methods in this region also capture Olive Ridleys incidentally but to a lesser extent than shrimp trawl fishery (Frazier et al. 2007). Bycatch in trawl fisheries off Sergipe State in Brazil is considered the most pressing threat to that population (Thomé et al. 2003). In the eastern Atlantic, the incidental capture of Olive Ridleys by commercial fisheries is thought to be a significant threat but very little systematic data is available (Frazier et al. 2007). Incidental mortality of Olive Ridleys is worst along the coast of Orissa, India with arribada Olive Ridleys gathering to nest were fishing effort is high. Every year since the early 1980s, thousands or tens of thousands of Olive Ridleys have stranded dead on the Orissa beaches, presumably as a result of incidental capture in shrimp trawls (Pandav 2000). A gill net fishery also operates in the region and contributes to the ridley mortality along this coastline. Incidental capture in fisheries is also believed to be a serious threat in the eastern Pacific (Frazier et al. 2007) where Olive Ridleys aggregate in large numbers off shore from nesting beaches (Kalb et al. 1995, Kalb 1999), but the information available is incomplete (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995, NMFS/USFWS 1998). Incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in this region has been documented in shrimp trawl fisheries, longline fisheries, purse seine fishery and gill net fisheries (Frazier et al. 2007). Incidental capture of sea turtles in shrimp trawls is a serious threat along the coast of Central America, with an estimated annual capture for all species of marine turtle exceeding 60,000 turtles, most of which are Olive Ridleys (Arauz 1996). Recent growth in the longline fisheries of this region are also a serious and growing threat to Olive Ridleys and have the potential to capture hundreds of thousands of Ridleys annually (Frazier et al., 2007). Bycatch of Olive Ridleys is high in Indonesian tuna long-lines and shrimp trawls although mortality appears to be low (WWF Indonesia, unpublished data).Habitat impactsDegradation, transformation and destruction of natural conditions at nesting beaches from coastal developments continue to threaten the long-term survival of many Olive Ridley rookeries. Transformation of nesting habitat comes from the construction of new aquaculture ponds, fishing harbours and tourist facilities, as well as growth of existing coastal villages which are increasing in many parts of the world within the range of the Olive Ridley, particularly along the east coast of India (Pandav and Choudhury 1999) and in some zones in coastal México to Central America (Cornelius et al. 2007). These impacts contribute stress directly through the loss of nesting habitat or indirectly through changes in the thermal profiles of the beach, increased light pollution (Witherington 1992) and sewage effluents.Global warming has the potential to impact the habitats and ecosystems of Olive Ridley populations worldwide (Hays et al. 2003, Weishampal 2004) but the specific impacts are purely speculative at this time. Most accounts have focused on the impact of global warming on incubation temperatures of eggs, which influence the sex ratio of the embryos (Hays et al. 2003).Diseases and predationExtremely little is known about diseases and their effects on Olive Ridley abundance. The only disease identified in the literature for Olive Ridleys is fibropapilloma, a herpes-virus found in sea turtles nearly worldwide (Herbst 1994). The incidence of fibropapilloma is not believed to be high in Olive Ridleys but has been observed in Olive Ridleys nesting in Costa Rica (Herbst 1994) and in México (Vasconcelos et al. 2000). At some individual rookeries, the predation by wild pigs and/or feral dogs can be substantial (e.g., in the Andaman Islands; Andrews et al. 2001). Infestation of developing eggs by fly and beetle larvae can cause significant mortality of embryos. In an extremely worrying case, the beetle larvae (Omorgus suberosus fabricius) has become a plague in the world’s largest arribada rookery in Escobilla, México where it is provoking steep drops in the hatching efficiency of the clutches laid, from a typical 30% for this colony (Márquez 1990) to less than 5% in some areas (López-Reyes and Harfush 2000). When combined with the relatively low hatching rates of high-density arribada beaches and the destruction of eggs laid by previous nesters, this problem could provoke the rookery’s decline.'),(66720,'Hippocampus trimaculatus','Three-spot Seahorse, Low-crowned Seahorse, Flat-faced Seahorse','Vulnerable','Listed','fishes','Syngnathidae','Syngnathiformes','Actinopterygii','Chordata','Animalia','http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=66720',0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,2024,'decreasing','Hippocampus trimaculatus is most often found at depths greater than 10 m with a maximum reported depth for this species being 100 m (Lourie et al. 2004).  This species utilizes soft substrates such as sand and mud as well as macro algae and soft corals (Nguyen and Do 1996, Choo and Liew 2003, Lourie et al. 2004). As these are similar habitats to where shrimp trawling often occurs (FAO 2008), this makes H. trimaculatus especially susceptible to exploitation as bycatch in the tropical shrimp trawl fishery. Shrimp trawling is also known to be causing a decline in the quality of these habitats (FAO 2008), which is suspected to effect H. trimaculatus. Although the habitat preferences of this species have not been studied in detail, anecdotal evidence suggests that, at least in Malaysia, this species prefers sandy and muddy substrates similar to those inhabited by tropical shrimp (Lim, in. litt. 2012).All seahorse species have vital parental care, and many species studied to date have high site fidelity (Perante et al. 2002, Foster and Vincent 2004), highly structured social behaviour (Vincent and Sadler 1995), and relatively sparse distributions (Lourie et al. 1999) -  traits that make seahorses especially vulnerable to over-exploitation. Seahorses also have some traits, such as small body size, fast growth and high fecundity, that may confer resilience to exploitation pressures (Morgan 2007). However a specialized life-history coupled with a dependence on relatively shallow habitats that are subject to extremely high fishing pressure, and the fact that seahorses do not move very much and are thus easily captured, means they are very vulnerable to over-exploitation. The importance of life history parameters in determining response to exploitation has been demonstrated for a number of species, including seahorses (Jennings et al. 1998, Foster and Vincent 2004).','The primary threat to Hippocampus trimaculatus is bycatch in incidental and target fisheries throughout its range including Malaysia and Thailand (Choo and Liew 2003, Perry et al. 2010), Vietnam (Giles et al. 2005, Meeuwig et al. 2006) and India (Salin et al. 2005, Murugan et al. 2011). These fisheries, specifically shrimp and other trawl fisheries, are known to cause substantial damage to the habitats in which they occur (FAO 2001, FAO 2008). Although the majority of seahorses are caught as bycatch, there are some small fisheries that target seahorses (Giles et al. 2005, Salin et al. 2005, Perry et al. 2010), which are presumably driven by the demand for seahorses in traditional medicine and the aquarium trade.Seahorses life history and ecological traits may increase their susceptibility to these threats (see Habitats and Ecology).'),(59257,'Natator depressus','Flatback Turtle','Vulnerable','Listed','reptiles','Cheloniidae','Testudines','Reptilia','Chordata','Animalia','http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=59257',0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,2024,'decreasing','Terrestrial nest sites','The common threats to this species of turtles are from the collection of eggs and meat, chemicals and pollution in the ocean, destruction of the nests and their feeding habitat.

Newborns weigh 4.0-4.4 kg (Laws 1993). Females attain sexual maturity at five years of age (Bester 1995). Gestation lasts 51 weeks. Longevity is unknown (Reijnders et al. 1993).Subantarctic Fur Seals are polygynous, males defend territories with vocal and postural displays and fighting (Bester 1981, Kerley 1983). They prefer rough rocky or boulder beaches with sources of shade or exposure to prevailing winds (Bester 1982). Pups are born from late October to early January, with a peak in mid-December. Females give birth within six days of arriving at the colony with oestrous and mating occurs eight to 12 days later. Females spend the time between the births of their pups and oestrous with their newborn before mating and departing for the first of a series of foraging trips they will make before weaning their pup at approximately 11 months of age (Bester 1981, Kerley 1983, Goldsworthy 1999). Trip durations of mothers increase over the course of lactation from six to 10 days to 23-28 days (Goldsworthy 1999, Georges and Guinet 2000, Kirkman et al. 2002). Dives become deeper and slightly longer over the summer. Dives are seldom deeper than 100 m (but up to 208 m) or longer than four minutes (Georges et al. 2000). Foraging behaviour varies between subpopulations (Robinson et al. 2002, Beauplet et al. 2004, Bailleul et al. 2005, de Bruyn et al. 2009).Subantarctic Fur Seals are opportunistic and pelagic foragers. They feed on myctophid and notothenid fish, cephalopods, and small numbers of crustaceans at Gough Island (Bester and Laycock 1985), the Prince Edward Islands (Klages and Bester 1998, Makhado et al. 2013), Macquarie Island (Goldsworthy et al. 1997, Robinson et al. 2002) and the Isles Crozet (Cherel et al. 2007, Kernaléguen et al. 2012). At Amsterdam Island they have been recorded to take Rockhopper Penguins (Paulian 1964).Subantarctic Fur Seals are sympatric with other species of Fur Seals at three sites. Low levels of hybridization with Antarctic Fur Seals occurs at the Prince Edward Islands (Hofmeyr et al. 2006a) and the Îles Crozet (Kingston and Gwilliam 2007). Hybridization  occurs with both Antarctic Fur Seals and New Zealand Fur Seals at Macquarie Island (Lancaster et al. 2006, Goldsworthy et al. 2009, Lancaster et al. 2010).','Similar to all of the other southern Fur Seals, Subantarctic Fur Seals were over-exploited by sealers in the 18th and 19th century and were reduced to the brink of extinction at the beginning of the 20th century. Since then their population has increased rapidly and they have reoccupied much of their former range (Bester 1987, Kerley 1987, Roux 1987, Guinet et al. 1994). While the abundance of two of the major subpopulations are thought to be stable (Guinet et al. 1994, Bester et al. 2006, SCAR EGS 2008), that of the third has recently decreased (Bester et al. 2009, Wege et al. in prep.). Wege et al. (in prep.) suggest that this may be due to the effects of density dependent food limitation on adult female fecundity. It is also possible that climate change has played a role in the decline. Climate change is potentially detrimental to Fur Seals through impacts on the abundance and distribution of prey species and changes in environmental conditions (Learmonth et al. 2006, Kovacs et al. 2012, McDonald et al. 2012, McBride et al. 2014).Few fisheries take place in waters occupied by this species but fisheries may expand in their range (Hanchet et al. 2003). Anthropogenic marine debris, primarily from the fishing industry is responsible for entanglements. At the Prince Edward Islands incidences of debris entanglement are less than one percent for the combined Antarctic/Subantarctic Fur Seal populations (Hofmeyr et al. 2002).Fur seals are also at risk of mass mortality from infectious diseases because of they congregate in large numbers, and because they were subject to a population bottleneck that has reduced their genetic variation (Lavigne and Schmitz 1990, Wynen et al. 2000). The isolation of their breeding habitat, however, affords them some degree of protection (Lavigne and Schmitz 1990, Chown et al. 1998). The small recovering population at Macquarie Island is at risk from predation by New Zealand Sea Lions and hybridization (Robinson et al. 1999, Goldsworthy et al. 2008).');
