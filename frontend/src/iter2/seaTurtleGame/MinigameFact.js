      description:
        "Did you know that up to 90% of sea turtles mistakenly consume plastic bags, confusing them for their favorite prey—jellyfish? This tragic error often leads to fatal consequences, as the ingested plastic can cause blockages, malnutrition, and ultimately death. prey—jellyfish?
